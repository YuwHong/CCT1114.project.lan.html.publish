    <h2>  Learning Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This journey has been incredibly rewarding so far. Starting from zero, I now feel confident writing clean HTML and CSS, 
      and I'm becoming more comfortable with JavaScript. I've realized that building projects is the best way to learn â€” each 
      challenge helps me uncover gaps in my knowledge and pushes me to grow. I'm excited about diving deeper into JavaScript 
      frameworks and backend development. I have learned that persistence, curiosity, and community support are key to success 
      in tech.
